# What is Jeson Mor?

[Jeosn Mor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeson_Mor "Jeson Mor on Wikipedia") is a board strategy game considered to be a [variant of Chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chess_variants "Chess variants on Wikipedia"). It is based on chess as it includes some of its concepts in the game, however the rules are much simpler and involving fewer components in one match. This game is simpler to play than chess, but can be pretty tricky to play nonetheless.

## The rules of the game

Jeson Mor, which for brevity we will refer to as: _JM_, is played on a 9x9 chessboard. Normally a chessboard is 8x8, but this game adds one more column and one more row. This is done to allow room for one special house on the board located at the very center of it: `r5:c5` \(row 5 and column 5\); this house is special and has a different color than the other ones \(usually red\).
