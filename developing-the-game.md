# Developing the game

Jeson Mor can be a very fun game to play, but we are going to do something even funnier than that. As developers, we get do develop the thing and then play with it! How cool is that?

## Our plan
Our development exercise is going through a few phases:

1. **Concept design:** Here we don't code, we just take a piece of paper and write down how the game should look like.
2. **Architecture design:** Still no coding here. We decide what components we need and how they should interact together.
3. **Development:** We finally get our hands dirty in the code.
4. **Testing** We go through some testing of the game to see that everything is working as expected.

## Resource planning
A very important thing to consider when developing something, not just games but also applications in general, is to think about what resources we are going to need. So we basically ask ourselves these questions:

- Are there any images I will need?
- Are there any icons I will need?
- Any videos, animations I will need?
- Sounds?

In our case we are going to need a few images. Though those are going be provided by this tutorial for you to simply download and use, you can always create your own (I will give you a few hints).
