# Extending the `House` module

Before we dig into further development of the board, we need to extend module `House` because we are going to need some more functionalities there that we are soon going to use. So let's jump to `house.js` and see what it is that we need there:

- We need a function for removing the horse from the house, in case one is placed in it.
- We need a function to tell us whether there is an horse in the house.
- We need a function to get the position of the house.
- And we also need a function that gives us the color of the horse in the house, if any.

`unset`, `isSet`, `getPosition`, `getHorseColor`

You will see in the next chapter, that all these functions we have just enumerated are going to be necessary. So let's do the work upfront.
