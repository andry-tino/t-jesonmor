# Defining the initial page

The first thing we wanna do is defining the content of `index.html`. This file is pretty important. To run the game, the user will just need to open this page and that's it. The page will contain the code to execute the Javascript files we will include inside it and display the board with all the pieces.

Technically speaking, we say that this file is the _entry point_ of our application.

## The structure of a generic HTML page
This file, as the extension suggests, is an [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) file. HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is a language which is not used to write a program, that is a _programming language_. HTML is a _markup language_, namely a language used to tell a program how to display something.

The program we need to tell how and what to display is a web browser such as Chrome, Firefox, Edge or Safari. All of them are able to understand HTML.
