A step by step tutorial for creating a Jeson Mor game in Javascript, CSS and HTML in your browser.

This is the development branch with the code for the game and the code for every single step referenced by the [Tutorial GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/book/andry-tino/creating-a-jeson-mor-game-in-javascript/details).
